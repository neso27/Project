		<h2> Continuation of the novel of the Dark Night and the Black Flag. &nbsp; </h2>
		

		<p> The battle continues. </p>

		<p> The storm has arrived ... And before the gate of a mighty fortress, whose ramparts reach the sky, the great Ottoman Empire's ordeals have fired and sharpened their handguns. Among the walls of the city, one knight, one lady and one reputation, will become non-enemies of their own destiny. </p>

		<p> In the autumn of 1386, after the fall of Pirot, a powerful Turkish Ordion led by Sultan Murat arrives in the valley of Nisava. Prince Lazar, aware of the danger to his country, is not sure where the Turks will strike: to Kruševac or to Niš. That is why, in the mighty fortress of the city of Nis, </p> 
		
		<p> he sends his godfather, the Krajina Duke Milan Toplic, with the task of commanding the city's defense in the case of the Ottoman siege. That prince's decision is not the will of Kennel Nenadi, the lord of Nis, who will therefore clash with the Duke of Duchy, and all the more complicates when Nenad discovers that his cousin Dostana favors a young knight, </p> 
		
		<p> although he is promised to another prosecutor. While Niš is preparing for a great battle, the knights of the Order of the Dragon, the Duke Ivan Kosančić and Pavle Orlović, are searching for Miloš Obilić, who are in an extremely unexpected place. An additional task will be to bring the relics of Saint Prokopi out of Nis under siege. At the same time, in the desert city on the edges of the Empire, Edmé and Young Prince Bajazit are struggling with the forces and temptations that are not from this world ... </p>

		<p> Storm rampart is a continuation of the story of the knights of the Order of the Dragon, the rise and fall of the Serbian medieval state, the siege of Nis and the Battle of Pločnik. </p>
