		<h2> About the book </h2>
	
		<p> When Howard Elayas, a high-ranking black lawyer, was found dead in the Let angel railroad, all detectives in the Los Angeles City Police wanted them to get past the case. As Elajas specializes in lawsuits linked to the use of police violence, racism and corruption, suspicion of this murder falls on all Los Angeles police officers without exception. Detective Harry Bosch is in charge of the investigation. Elaiah's murder took place on the eve of a very important trial: </p> 
		
		<p> as a lawyer for Nigel Michael Harris, Elayas leads a civil lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department for the use of violence in an investigation that caused his client to experience hearing damage. Haris is acquitted of the rape and murder of a 12-year-old white girl, but many, including Detective Boss, still consider him guilty. Elayas announced that the trial would have a dual purpose: to put an end to the police guilty of violence and to reveal the one who really killed the girl. </p> 
		
		<p> After Rodney King, racial disorder of 1992 and the trials of O. DÅ¾. Simpson, the City of Angels is on the verge of another plane. To discover the truth, you will have to dig deep down your own yard and find that there are deep pits of suspicion and hatred under him that could explode into his face. As if he does not have enough concern, his happiness with Elinor Vish appears to be short-lived: the drawing pulls his wife back to where she can not follow her, to return to herself. </p>
