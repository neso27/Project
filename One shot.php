		<h2> The Roman after which the world film hit Jack Reacher was shot. &nbsp; </h2>

		<p> "Great, unconvincing ... unreal, pure gold. This book simply electrifies you ... And the entire series makes you addicts. "New York Times

		Six shots. Five of the dead. Terror has ruled over a provincial town. But the police resolved everything within a few hours: everything is crystal clear and easy. All but one. The Accused declares: You have caught the wrong man. And then he says: Bring me Richard. </p>

		<p> And indeed, former military investigator Jack Richer is coming. What kind of incident from the past associates this apparently psycho with a former military policeman now wandering around the country? Richester is convinced that something is wrong - and crystal clear, an easy case shoots and decays to pieces.

		For this series of thrillers, Lee Caylee, critics say that the readers create addicts. On the hook of the novel One Hit, you will surely get caught. </p>

		<p> "Enchanting the Furious Rhythm" Los Angeles Times </p>

		<p> "The first-rate thriller in which cold-blooded Richard is in his way executing justice over criminals." Sunday Telegraph </p>

		<p> "Incredibly exciting and informative when it comes to weapons and technology ... A powerful feeling for good and bad." Literary Review </p>
